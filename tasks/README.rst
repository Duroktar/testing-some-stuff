Hey Paul,

I'm gonna use C:\> as shorthand to mean whatever folder you unzip
the package into. This is a basic app that allows you to access 
your task DB as a RESTful interface. ie, from online somewhere.
checkout the guide below and let me know what you think. Scott


First install dependancies

   C:\> pip install -r requirements.txt

Then open 2 terminal. 

In the first run 
    C:\> server.bat

In the seconde run 
    C:\> python client.py

Follow the terminal :)

http://localhost:7878/tasks
